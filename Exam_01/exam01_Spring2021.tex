\begin{enumerate}
\item A payday lender charges \$60 for a loan of \$500 for 15 days. Find the annual interest rate. (Use a 360-day year.)

\item Suppose \$30,000 is invested at an annual interest rate of 1.2\%.  Compute the future value after 10 years if the interest rate is compounded monthly.  Round to the nearest cent.

\item Suppose an investment account has an annual interest rate of 4.3\%.  How long does it take an investment to double if interest is compounded quarterly?  Round to the nearest tenth of a year.

\item An investment account triples it's value after 20 years. If the account compounds continuously, what is the interest rate?  Round to the nearest tenth of a percent.

\item How much must be invested now at UW Credit Union so that 6 years from now the
amount would be \$44,500? Assume the Interest rate is 3\% compounded quarterly.

\item Three banks have investment accounts that compound their interest differently.  Which of the three accounts grows the fastest?  Which grows the slowest? \\
A) Bank A has an interest rate of 5.6\% compounded annually \\
B) Bank B has an interest rate of 5.3\% compounded monthly \\
C) Bank C has an interest rate of 5.2\% compounded continuously
