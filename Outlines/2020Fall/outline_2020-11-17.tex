Who: All students (Tuesday and Thursday)
Time: Regular class time but arrive early
Where: The Wisconsin Room, in the Union. This is not our usual room.
Sec 608           11:00-11:50     Wisconsin Room East
Sec 610           12:00-12:50     Wisconsin Room West
Sec 612           13:00-13:50     Wisconsin Room East

If you are unable to make it, notify me immediately. If you will miss it due to COVID, you 
must make other arrangements BEFORE November 19.

The exam will be 20 problems, each worth 5 points. No notes or books are allowed. A 
non-graphing calculator is permitted. You must show all of your work. Correct answers 
without sufficient work will receive little to no credit. Answer every question to get 
some credit.

Lastly, Professor Schultz posted a review video. The exam will be very close to the review.
