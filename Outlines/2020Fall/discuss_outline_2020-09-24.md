If you are unable to make it, notify me immediately. If you will miss it due to COVID, you must make other arrangements before October 1.

The exam will be 20 problems, each worth 5 points. No notes or books are allowed. A non-graphing calculator is permitted. You must show all of your work. Correct answers without sufficient work will receive little to no credit.

Lastly, Professor Schultz posted a review video. The exam will be very close to the review.
