Online Only after Thanksgiving

As you probably already know, UWM will be shifting nearly all remaining in-person classes to online only instruction. Yes, this does affect our class.

We meet face to face on Nov 17, Nov 19 for the exam, and Nov 24, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
 
On Dec 1, Dec 3, Dec 8, and Dec 10 we will meet online synchronously. That means you should attend every discussion at its scheduled time. I will take attendance and note participation.

The Math 208 teaching group is currently working on arrangements for the synchronous online version of the final exam.

I will hand out an updated syllabus to all students on Thursday and make certain that you understand the change. Also look for the updated syllabus on Canvas.
