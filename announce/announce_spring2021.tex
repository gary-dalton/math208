HOMEWORK 8.3, EXTRA CREDIT, AND EXAM QUESTIONS

Homework 8.3 is canceled! If you already submitted work, you will receive credit for that work.

\bgroup
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
	\hline
	Section & Due Date \\
	\hline
	8.1 & 3/9 \\
	\hline
	8.2 & 3/11 \\
	\hline
	\sout{8.3} & \sout{3/16} \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\egroup

Extra Credit of 5 points is still available but I am changing the due date to Friday, 3/19, after the exam. It is Page 455, number 44, a conditional probability problem.

Finally, there will be 15 questions on the exam, not 20. I will update the answer template to match this.

UPDATED COURSE SCHEDULE

\section*{2/18/2021b}
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Hi All,

We have indications that there has been some less than 100\% honest behavior in regards to Test 1. Copying is obviously not allowed. Nor is providing answers. I believe most students do not engage in such behavior and I appreciate your integrity. I feel I should let everyone know, however, that the university takes academic dishonesty very seriously (as do I). It is important to me that every student (every instructor too) is treated fairly and equally and all have the same chances at success and excellence.

Reminder: Please be sure to show all your work on your exams in Math 208 this term.

--Professor Sparks

ID REMINDER

This is a reminder to have your ID ready to show me in the virtual session. I prefer your student ID but if you do not have that then another valid ID will work. You receive a link to the exam after  displaying your ID.
