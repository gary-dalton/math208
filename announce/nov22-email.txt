Some did not do as well as expected in Exam 3. I attribute this to lack of attendance or not watching the recordings and not working through the homework. There is a clear divergence between those who attend and submit their homework and those who don't.

There are still a lot of points available in this course. So, you may still be able to get the grade you need.

We are going virtual-only. That means my discussions will be synchronous during our class times and you are expected to attend every discussion. If you do not attend, you will likely not improve your score.
