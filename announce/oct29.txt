# Instruction Feedback Survey

Please complete the Instruction Feedback Survey. This anonymous survey is your in-class assignment for this Exam 2 week of 10/26. It is only 7 multiple choice questions that inform me of how I can improve to make your learning better. The feedback survey is in the November slide-down. I'll keep it open for the month but you will only get credit for it if you complete it prior to the end of next week. https://uwmil.instructure.com/courses/317918/quizzes/554670?module_item_id=7747598

# Canvas De-clutter

Also, I am trying a new structure on Canvas. Things seemed like they were getting cluttered. All new homework and readings for November weeks will be added to the November slide-down. I'll add new items to the top of that slide down, so that what you need to do next is always near the top.
